    Add your logic to this function. This function will simulate a streaming

    data row received from the stream.

    The context object will persist between iterations of your algorithm.

        csv_row (str): one exchange trade (format: "exchange pair", "price", "volume", "timestamp")
        context (dict[str, Any]): a context that will survive each iteration of the algorithm

    Generator:
        response (dict): "Fill"-type object with information for the current and unfilled trades

    Yield (None | Trade | [Trade]): a trade order/s; None indicates no trade action
